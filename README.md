# Speech-Recognizer-WepOpener
This program uses the speech_recognizer library on Python. 
When run, the user speaks a website out loud and the program will open a web browser and search for it.

## Long term goal
This was me experimenting with the speech recognizer library in Python with the ultimate goal of developing an app with the OpenAI API.
I would like to create a more conversational version of ChatGPT where you can speak to ChatGPT and ask it questions without having to type it all out.

This idea came from Jarvis from the Iron Man movies, which every nerdy engineer would love to have.
